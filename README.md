# fivem-rp

## information

hello, and welcome to the `fivem-rp` repo. this is just a little repo that includes an `asi` for gtav fivem to include a cpp framework for adding "plugins" and comes with pre-installed plugins.

i made it because i needed something to enhance my rp when on other servers. it includes many features and i will probably add more as time goes on

## features it has

* disable blips
* disable gamertags
* enable reticle (even when disabled by server)
* disable vehicle rolling, but enable motocycle

## pulling / issues

### issues
if you would like to add something, or you have a bug (where it probably crashes the game), create an issue [here](https://github.com/blockba5her/fivem-rp/issues)

### pulling
if you would like to add a feature and you do know cpp, then go ahead and fork it, add it using the framework, and i will review it and probably accept the pull request.

also thnx if you do fork n pull
